# Quantifying Dissonance
Currently, in my third year of university I am doing a project on how to measure the dissonance of music. 

To accompany this project, i have written some code testing out different algorithms to see how they compare to how we percieve dissonance.

So far i have developed my algorithms for Roughness and Tonalness.

This project is work in progress
